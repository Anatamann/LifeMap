# Database Structure Analysis

This directory contains alternative database designs and analysis for the LifeMap application.

## Current Database Structure

### Existing Tables
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `journal_entries` - Daily journal entries with mood and habits

### Current Schema Analysis
- Simple two-table structure
- Direct relationship between users and entries
- JSONB for habits storage
- Date stored as both string and timestamp

## Alternative Structures to Analyze

1. **Normalized Habits Structure**
2. **Mood Analytics Optimization**
3. **Goal Tracking Integration**
4. **Performance Optimization**
5. **Multi-tenant Architecture**

## Analysis Methods

- Schema comparison tables
- Performance impact analysis
- Migration complexity assessment
- Feature capability comparison
- Data integrity considerations
